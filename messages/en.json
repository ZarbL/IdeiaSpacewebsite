      "description": "During the Space Challenge, students experience all stages of a real mission. They start by defining a problem and the satellite's objective, plan how it will operate and what data it will collect, program their sensors on an educational platform, and perform tests and simulations. The project culminates in the launch of a PocketQube into orbit, allowing students to monitor its operation and analyze real data. Throughout the process, they develop technical skills, scientific thinking, teamwork, and a vision for the future in the space field."

        "description": "UaiSat is a PocketQube space equipment, shaped as a 5 cm cube on each side. Besides being the first from Minas Gerais state, it is the first PocketQube developed by a Brazilian university and launched into space. It will orbit the planet at an average altitude of 500 to 600 km, with an expected lifespan of 2 years.\n\n**Mission Objective**\n\nUaiSat's main mission is to validate technology in orbit in addition to collecting data on agriculture and other productive sectors in Minas Gerais, such as soil data, temperature, humidity, among others. It will also monitor lightning and storms, using technology developed in partnership with the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). The main mission is the validation of technology in the space environment."

The Radio Payload consists of a Store and Forward system in which the satellite is able to receive messages from ground transmitters, store them, and transmit them when flying over a ground station. The mission also carries a radiation sensor capable of measuring Alpha and Beta radiation. This sensor is especially interesting because it was developed nationally to be low-cost and relatively accurate. This is possible using photodiodes.\n\n**Mission Objective**\n\nGalaxy Explorer is a technological mission that aims to conduct radiation measurement experiments using low-cost photodiode-based sensors. The mission will also demonstrate the in-orbit operation of a 1P PocketQube platform developed in Brazil in a partnership between All2Space and entrepreneur Kevin Tang Xilai."
